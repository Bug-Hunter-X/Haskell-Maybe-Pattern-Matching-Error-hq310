This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell programming: failing to handle the `Nothing` case when pattern matching on the `Maybe` type. The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, which causes a runtime exception when `getStringLength` is called with `Nothing`. The `bugSolution.hs` file provides a corrected version that handles both `Just` and `Nothing` cases using pattern matching.
